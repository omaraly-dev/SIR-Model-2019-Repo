This is a project I developed in early Dec. 2019 to explore generating and modeling large datasets in the context of a pandemic. Due to global events, I opted to not publish it until recently. As a result, everything was just pushed as-is from when I completed the project on a local environment when I was less familiar with C++ and Python.

The attached informal report includes a deep-dive into the code as well as some starting statistical analysis I performed on the data. 

There are no plans at this time to update any of this code, but compilation instructions as well as an extensively commented class header are included and should be read for anyone seeking to build off of this. 

If you have any questions, feel free to forward them to the contact email in the code comments or to omar@oaly.dev.
