Compilation Instructions:

Intel Compiler:
	Use icpc -c infection_classes.h to compile the infection_classes header file that all simulations are dependent on.
	Use icpc -c <program_name>.cpp to compile whichever simulation you're interested in running.
	Use icpc -o <program_name> <program_name>.o infection_classes.o to link the two together and to produce an executable.

GCC Compiler:
	Use g++ -c infection_classes.h to compile the infection_classes header file that all simulations are dependent on.
	Use g++ -c <program_name>.cpp to compile whichever simulation you're interested in running.
	Use g++ -o <program_name> <program_name>.o to link the two together and to produce an executable.
